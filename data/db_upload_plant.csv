saintpaulia ionanthais,"The African Violet is a popular flowering houseplant from the Saintpaulia genus, originating from Eastern Africa. There are thousands of varieties and hybrids with different flower colors and leaf types. 
The flowers of the African Violet plant resemble violets, but they are not in the same family as a normal violet plant. The African Violet is small and compact, with a diameter ranging from 3 inches to 16 inches. It has soft, furry, and round or oval leaves. 
Growers can propagate the plant from leaf cuttings (the Chimera African Violet propagates from the suckers, rather than leaf cuttings), with a little patience as it often takes several weeks or even months for roots to develop.
The African Violet is non-toxic.

The plant produces attractive dark-green, leathery-textured and oblong-shaped leaves with grayish green smears or blotches (known as mottled). The flowers that bloom are about 2 -3 inches in diameter with two wing petals, a larger upright petal and a kind of slipper shaped lip.
While many Orchids can be quite fussy specimens, which is one of the reasons only a few are grown indoors, the Paphiopedilum perennial plant is one of the easier orchid type flowering plants to grow and maintain, although, they still can be quite particular about the conditions they reside in.
The plant originates from Southeast Asia.
